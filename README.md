## About The Project

This project had a dual focus. Primarily, it aimed to acquire proficiency in web scraping using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/). Secondly, it sought to revamp the existing website, [DoesItMutate](https://doesitmutate.xyz/). I frequently rely on this website to refresh my memory regarding array methods that induce mutations. However, one drawback I encountered was the cumbersome navigation to specific arrays. The sole search method available is the browser's built-in search, which often yields multiple results, particularly inconvenient on mobile devices. In my redesign, I addressed this issue by incorporating a sticky sidebar for swift method selection on desktops and a user-friendly search bar with a dropdown menu of all methods for mobile users. Transferring all data manually from the original website would have been time-consuming, making this project an ideal opportunity to leverage a web scraper for automation.
